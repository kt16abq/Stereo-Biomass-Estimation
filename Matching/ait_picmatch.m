%
% The function takes two images as argument and using edge detection
% checks whether they are the same or not...a cool and simple code which
% can be used in security systems.
% The level at which the two pictures should be matched can be controlled
% by changing the code at line 100.

% USAGE (SAMPLE CODE)
%
%
%       pic1 = imread('cameraman.tif');
%       pic2 = imread('cameraman.tif');
%       ait_picmatch(pic1,pic2);
%       
%       
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    ;

end

    ;

    pic2 = rgb2gray(pic2);

%so that we obtain white and black points and edges of the objects present
%in the picture.

edge_det_pic1 = edge(pic1,'prewitt');

%%applying edge detection on second picture
%so that we obtain white and black points and edges of the objects present
%in the picture.

edge_det_pic2 = edge(pic2,'prewitt');

%definition of different variables to be used in the code below

%output variable if pictures have been matched.
OUTPUT_MESSAGE = ' Hence the pictures have been matched, SAME PICTURES ';

%output variable if objects in the whole picture have not been matched.
OUTPUT_MESSAGE2 = ' Hence the pictures have not been matched, DIFFERENT PICTURES ';

%initialization of different variables used
matched_data = 0;
white_points = 0;

x=0;
y=0;
l=0;
m=0;

%for loop used for detecting black and white points in the picture.

        else
            black_points = black_points+1;
        end
    end
end

%for loop comparing the white (edge points) in the two pictures
for i = 1:1:256
    for j = 1:1:256
        if(edge_det_pic1(i,j)==1)&(edge_det_pic2(i,j)==1)

%calculating percentage matching.
total_data = white_points;
total_matched_percentage = (matched_data/total_data)*100;

%outputting the result of the system.
if(total_matched_percentage >= 90)          %can add flexability at this point by reducing the amount of matching.
